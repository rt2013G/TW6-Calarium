Calarium is a project I made for my university course of Web Technologies,
with the idea of creating an interactive website about space exploration featuring an auth system, cloud saves
and text chat.

I'm still yet unsure what the real meaning of "space exploration" actually is, my idea is to either build a small 
game set in a procedurally generated planet, or a virtual reality experience based on real galaxies. I'll try 
to learn more and see what I come up with.
