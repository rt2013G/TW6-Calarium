# TW6-Calarium
This is a project created for my university course of _Web Tecnologies_, with the purpose of designing and building
a web application in its entirety, including both the front end and the back end, with tools of our choice.

## Overview
_Calarium_ itself is a game I made in Unity, which features a procedurally generated planet that
the user has to survey and analyze.\
The purpose of this web application is to provide an additional layer of interactivity with the players: 
it serves as an online client where people can not only download the game but also connect with one another through
various different provided services, almost as if this were a game on its own.
